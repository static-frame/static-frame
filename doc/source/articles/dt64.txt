Description
Detailed outline.


NumPy supports a date and time array datatype called ``datetime64``. Unlike Python's standard library types (``datetime`` and ``date``), ``datetime64`` supports an extensive range of time units, from year to attosecond. This specification of unit permits unambiguous resolution specification, more narrow typing of time information, and taking full advantage of time ranges that fit within the underlying representation (a 64-bit signed integer).

This talk will introduce ``datetime64`` arrays and describe their features and performance in comparison to Python's ``date`` and ``datetime`` types. Practical examples of working with, and converting between, these formats will be provided. As date and time information is particularly useful for labeled time-series data, the usage of ``datetime64`` in Pandas and StaticFrame indices will be examined. Pandas use of only a single unit (nanosecond) will be shown to lead to a "Y2262" problem and offer other disadvantages compared to StaticFrame's full support for ``datetime64`` units. Finally, StaticFrame's ``via_dt`` interface will be shown to offer utilities that make working with ``datetime64`` as easy as working with Python's ``date`` and ``datetime`` objects.

The audience for this talk is anyone working with NumPy ``datetime64`` or Pandas ``DatetimeIndex`` or ``Timestamp`` types, or those wanting to better understand the limitations of Python's ``date`` and ``datetime`` objects, particularly when used in NumPy arrays. Basic familiarity with these types is helpful but not required. This will be an informative presentation with concise code examples and practical tips for working with these types. Audience members will come away with a firm understanding of the limits and opportunities of these types, relevant for anyone working with time series data.




================================================================================

# min and max of nanosecond representation

>>> np.datetime64(np.iinfo(np.int64).max, 'ns')
numpy.datetime64('2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807')

>>> np.datetime64(np.iinfo(np.int64).min+1, 'ns')
numpy.datetime64('1677-09-21T00:12:43.145224193')


# pd.Timestamp internal representation uses same ints as ns

>>> pd.Timestamp('1990-01-01').value
631152000000000000

>>> np.datetime64('1990-01-01', 'ns').astype(int)
631152000000000000






#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandas models all date or timestamp values as NumPy ``datetime64[ns]`` (nanosecond) arrays, regardless of if nanosecond-level resolution is practical or appropriate. This creates a "Y2262 problem" for Pandas: dates beyond 2262-04-11 cannot be expressed. While I can create a ``pd.DatetimeIndex`` up to 2262-04-11, one day further and Pandas raises an error.

>>> pd.date_range('1980', '2262-04-11')
DatetimeIndex(['1980-01-01', '1980-01-02', '1980-01-03', '1980-01-04',
               '1980-01-05', '1980-01-06', '1980-01-07', '1980-01-08',
               '1980-01-09', '1980-01-10',
               ...
               '2262-04-02', '2262-04-03', '2262-04-04', '2262-04-05',
               '2262-04-06', '2262-04-07', '2262-04-08', '2262-04-09',
               '2262-04-10', '2262-04-11'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', length=103100, freq='D')
>>> pd.date_range('1980', '2262-04-12')
Traceback (most recent call last):
pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime.OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 2262-04-12 00:00:00


As indices are often used for date-time values far less granular than nanoseconds (such as dates, months, or years), StaticFrame offers the full range of NumPy typed ``datetime64`` indices. This permits exact date-time type specification, and avoids the limits of nanosecond-based units.

While not possible with Pandas, creating an index of years or dates extending to 3000 is simple with StaticFrame.
