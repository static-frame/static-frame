Out-Performing NumPy is Hard: Approaches to Writing C-Extensions


Abstract: 100 words

This presentation offers principles to help determine if an array-processing routine, implemented as a C-extension, might outperform NumPy routines called from Python. While the NumPy C API lets write C-code that builds or evaluates arrays, just writing C is often not enough to outperform NumPy.


Along the way, how to create a Python project that compiles C-extensions linking to NumPy will be demonstrated, and the basics of the NumPy C API will be introduced. A narrow use-case related to the ``np.nonzero()`` function will be implemented in C as an example.



Description

While it is well known that C-extensions can improve the performance of Python programs, writing C-extensions that improve the performance of NumPy array operations is different. Most NumPy functions already call highly optimized C routines, some of which take advantage of low-level processor optimizations. Writing C-extensions that out-perform NumPy is challenging: in most cases, just writing Python that calls NumPy is optimal. However, for routines that are of sufficiently narrow scope, there are opportunities.

This presentation offers principles to help determine if a routine, implemented as a C-extension, might outperform related NumPy routines called from Python. Along the way, how to create a Python project that compiles C-extensions linking to NumPy will be demonstrated, and the basics of the NumPy C API will be introduced.

A narrow use-case of the ``np.nonzero()`` function will be implemented in C as an example: rather than returning all indices of all non-zero values (for all dtypes and dimensionalities, as ``np.nonzero()`` does), this new function, ``first_true_1d()``, will return only the index of the first-encountered non-zero value (for one-dimensional Boolean arrays). The performance of this routine, and why it sometimes cannot out-perform ``np.nonzero()`` even though it does less, will be discussed.



Outline

The Challenge of Outperforming NumPy (2 min)
    Core NumPy operations are implemented in C
    Some NumPy operations take advantages of low-level processor optimizations
    Just using NumPy in Python is often optimal
    A sufficiently narrow process might offer performance advantages

Creating a Python Project that Compiles C-extensions with NumPy (4 min)
    Project configuration with setup.py or pyproject.toml
    Including NumPy headers
    Calling ``import_array()``

The Python C API and the NumPy C API (4 min)
    Shared naming conventions
    Casting between ``PyObject`` v. ``PyArrayObject`` pointers
    Reference counting ``PyArrayObject``
    Reference stealing of ``PyArray_Descr``

Common Operations with the NumPy C API (4 min)
    Creating a ``PyArray_Descr``
    Creating a ``PyArrayObject``
        ``PyArray_Empty()``
        ``PyArray_Zeros()``
    Getting basic array characteristics
        dtype
        Shape
        Dimensionality
        Data flags
            C / Fortran ordering
            Contiguity
    Reading / writing values from / to an array
        ``PyArray_GETITEM()``
        ``PyArray_GetPtr()``
    Array data as a C array
        ``PyArray_DATA()``
        ``NpyIter``

Anti-Patterns when Creating NumPy C-Extensions (2 min)
    Ignoring early performance comparisons
    Reimplementing what NumPy has already done
    Creating arrays from Python objects

Opportunities for Performance Advantage (2 min)
    Bulk of operations happen in C
    Can treat array data as a C array
        Using ``PyArray_DATA`` for reading and writing
    Can simplify what NumPy is doing
        Limit dimensionality
        Support narrow types
        Require contiguity

Example C-Extension Implementation: ``first_true_1d()`` (6 min)
    Finding the index of the first or last True in a Boolean array
    NumPy ``np.nonzero()`` does not short-circuit, returns an array
    NumPy ``np.argmax()`` does not distinguish the case of no True

    Opportunity to simplify what NumPy is doing
        Can limit supported dimensions and dtypes
        Can require contiguity
        Can return just an integer
    Opportunity to operate on data as a C array
        Can quickly scan C array of Booleans
        No Python objects or reference counting needed

    Details of ``first_true_1d()`` implementation
        Parsing arguments
        Validating array requirements, raising exceptions
        Using ``PyArray_DATA`` to get a pointer
        Using pointer arithmetic to scan the array
        Returning a ``PyObject`` integer

Performance Evaluation of ``first_true_1d()`` (4 min)
    Can outperform ``np.nonzero()`` when there are many Trues
    When few Trues exist, ``np.nonzero()`` surprisingly still outperforms
        Usage of loop unrolling to optimize branch prediction
        Usage of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) routines

Conclusion (2 min)
    Outperforming NumPy, even in C, is hard
    There exist opportunities by finding narrow cases
    Performance tests must be done early and often



Notes

An example of the C extension code that will be presented can be seen in the following PR: https://github.com/static-frame/arraykit/pull/84

For purposes of this presentation, that code will be extracted into a new project set up just to demonstrate the topics presented here.

**********************************
How does the CPU dispatcher work?
**********************************

NumPy dispatcher is based on multi-source compiling, which means taking
a certain source and compiling it multiple times with different compiler
flags and also with different **C** definitions that affect the code
paths. This enables certain instruction-sets for each compiled object
depending on the required optimizations and ends with linking the
returned objects together.
